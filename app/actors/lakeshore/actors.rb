module Lakeshore
  # Module for containing Actors specific to Lakeshore
  # As opposed to the actors within CurationConcerns, Lakeshore::Actors are used exclusively
  # within the Lakeshore application and are generally not a part of the actor stack that
  # is used by Sufia. The actors found here are used within the API and any other area
  # that is outside the main CC/Sufia stack.
